.TH factor 1 "26 November 1990"
.SH NAME
factor - prime-factor numbers
.SH SYNOPSIS
factor <int> <int>-<int> ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program will compute the prime factors of each number you
give it as an argument.
If no arguments are given, it will read numbers from standard input,
one per line.
In addition to simple integers, you can also specify a range of integers
as "<int>-<int>", or you can use up to 3 trailing wildcards.
Here are some examples:
